      <p><strong>Literature Review Rough Draft</strong></p>

      <p>Eddie Hart, Holly Hudson, and Colin have all graduated from university in the year 2024 with a degree in computing, Eddie and Colin with bachelor’s degrees in computer science (Fay), and Holly with a master’s degree in games design and development (BBC). When they all began to study their respective degrees, each aspired and dreamt of going through college and graduating with multiple job offers and well-paid salaries. They all proceeded to graduate with zero job offers and have spent countless hours applying to hundreds of tech companies to be met with arduous interview processes that require online coding assessments and interviews, and this is only if they can get their resume past a generative artificial intelligence sorting process. All three spent well over a year in a post-graduation job hunt to varying degrees of success; Eddie managed to land a job as a security engineer at a cybersecurity tech firm; Holly did not manage to land a job and has instead been freelancing developing her own videogames; Colin did not get hired and has pivoted away from tech entirely to pursue a career in the police force.</p>

      <p>Why is it so difficult for them to land their first job after graduation? Tech companies are beginning to utilize generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to automate various tasks and processes of which a brand new tech graduate would generally work on, in turn eliminating the need to hire new talent. Since the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, there has been a flurry of new research concerning the capabilities of GenAI and what it can do. A vast majority of research suggest that implementation of GenAI into the workforce will lead to improved worker productivity, cost-reduction, and new jobs while advising companies to not achieve cost-reduction through GenAI with typical methods such as layoffs, and instead seek to utilize it for employee assistance (Ebert).</p>

      <h2>Background and Context</h2>
      <p>However, much of the academic literature on GenAI and the workforce fail to mention one large subset of individuals who will be impacted by GenAI, the recent graduates who are searching for entry-level positions. A large majority of these graduates are the ones who will be competing for the same positions that GenAI can replace. Many of the studies that examine GenAI’s impact focus primarily on productivity metrics, economic forecasts, or case studies within established companies, rather than the transitional experiences of new graduates entering a shifting job market.</p>

    <section id="discussion">
      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>Yu and Qi’s 2024 study <em>“The Impact of Generative AI on Employment and Labor Productivity”</em> predicts that while generative AI will automate routine cognitive tasks, it will also lead to a net increase in high-skill labor demand in the long term. They suggest that generative AI will “free workers from monotonous tasks” (Yu & Qi 54), implying that opportunities for innovation and higher-order thinking will expand. However, this optimism does not necessarily align with the realities faced by computing graduates like Eddie, Holly, and Colin.</p>

      <p>According to Fay’s (2025) <em>BBC News</em> report, graduates in computer science have among the highest unemployment rates of any major, with six percent of computer science graduates and seven and a half percent of computer engineering graduates being unemployed. Holly’s experience in the gaming industry further demonstrates this disconnect. BBC News (2025) notes that only five percent of job openings in the UK gaming industry are labeled as “junior” or “entry-level.” Many developers have begun developing independently as companies cut costs and rely more heavily on GenAI tools to generate game assets and code. The same article points out that “studios are merging or closing entirely,” leaving new developers with few opportunities to enter the industry.</p>

      <p>On the corporate side, Christof Ebert (2025) argues that GenAI creates a “dividend” in software and IT by reducing operational costs through automation. His article emphasizes that generative AI allows organizations to accomplish more with fewer resources, making it more cost-effective to use AI systems than to hire new staff. He concludes that “the productivity dividend from GenAI is significant and unavoidable” (Ebert 155). For companies, this is a rational business decision; for graduates, it represents a barrier to entry.</p>

      <p>Another dimension of this issue involves psychological and emotional effects. Natasha Singer’s (2025) <em>New York Times</em> article “Goodbye, $165,000 Tech Jobs” captures the disillusionment of recent graduates whose dream jobs have disappeared. She reports that many graduates have turned to service jobs while trying to “keep their coding skills fresh” (Singer). Others, like Colin in this review, leave the tech field altogether. These experiences contrast sharply with media narratives that portray GenAI as a democratizing technology that opens new opportunities.</p>

      <p>Alabdulkarim et al. (2024) add nuance to the conversation by analyzing computing majors from a job market perspective, finding that while demand for computing-related skills remains high, the types of skills in demand are shifting rapidly. Employers increasingly prioritize AI literacy and prompt engineering skills. This creates a mismatch between traditional computing curricula and employer expectations, leaving graduates underprepared to market themselves in the GenAI era.</p>

      <p>In summary, the literature reveals a consistent optimism about generative AI’s potential to improve efficiency and productivity, but it fails to fully address the human cost and transitional challenges faced by new graduates. The current research landscape suggests a need for further study on how GenAI adoption reshapes early career trajectories in computing fields.</p>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Generative AI represents both a technological revolution and a disruption to traditional employment pathways. While many researchers focus on the macroeconomic benefits of GenAI integration, the micro-level impacts—especially on new computing graduates—demand equal attention. As companies continue to adopt AI-driven efficiencies, educators and policymakers must adapt curricula and job preparation resources to ensure graduates remain employable in a rapidly changing market.</p>
